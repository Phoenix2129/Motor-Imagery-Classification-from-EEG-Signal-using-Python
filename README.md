This repository provides the code for implementation of a novel deeplearning model for Motor Imagery Classification using EEG signals.
To implemet follow the below steps:
1. Download required libraries specified in header.
2. Download the required dataset from BCI Competition website [(BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a)]([url](https://www.bbci.de/competition/download/competition_iv/BCICIV_2a_gdf.zip))
3. After downloading the dataset , Rum the preprocessing Code first which will convert the data from GDF to CSV format for easier implementation.( Don't forget to change the location in code as per your required location)
4. Now implement the code for main model which will give the final results.

(**IT WILL BE ADVISED TO IMPLEMENT THE CODE IN GOOGLE COLLAB FOR BETTER RESULTS**)

**THE RESULTS FOR 9 DIFFERENT PERSONS ARE ATTACHED FOR REFRENCE, rESULTS CALCULATED USING THE GIVEN MODEL**
